1. Create the "employee" database:

    CREATE DATABASE employee;
    USE employee;

2. Create the following tables inside the “employee” database:

    CREATE TABLE department ( department_id INT PRIMARY KEY, department_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL);
    CREATE TABLE employee ( employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY, employee_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, salary DECIMAL(10, 2), department_id INT, FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES department(department_id));

3. Write Queries for the following:

    SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, d.department_name FROM employee e JOIN department d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
    SELECT employee_name, salary FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC;
    SELECT d.department_name, AVG(e.salary) AS average_salary FROM employee e JOIN department d ON e.department_id = d.department_id GROUP BY d.department_name;
