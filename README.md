Hey, I am Divya, currently in final year of Bachelor's of Technology majoring in Computer Science from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, Uttar Pradesh. I belong to a small town Khurja in Uttar Pradesh known for its ceramics. I have a strong foundation in C++ programming language, have a keen interest in problem solving and made some projects using MERN (MongoDb, Express, React, Node) stack. I am going to start working in Kickdrum as a software developer intern. I am too much excited to learn new skills here and contribute to the organization's success.
